1. Construct an NFA based on the Union, Star, and Concat therom.
2. Convert it to the DFA by the NFAtoDFA tool in the software.
3. Convert the DFA to the minmal DFA by the DFAtoMinDFA tool in the software. It divids the DFA into root, final, and non-final nodes. Expand on the non-final node and get the tree.
